# EDUchain - Decentralized Education Funding Platform

## Problem Statement

Access to education is often hindered by financial constraints, especially for students from underprivileged backgrounds. Traditional funding mechanisms like scholarships, loans, and grants are often inaccessible or come with significant challenges, such as high-interest rates, lack of transparency, and complex application processes. Furthermore, even when funds are secured, there is often no guarantee that they will be used as intended, leading to a lack of trust from potential supporters. This creates a barrier to education and limits opportunities for deserving students.

## Solution Statement

Our app provides a decentralized platform built on EDUchain, a blockchain specifically focused on education, where students can create campaigns to seek financial support. Support can be in the form of loans, grants, or non-repayable contributions. By leveraging the transparency and security of blockchain technology, we ensure that all transactions are traceable and that funds are used appropriately. This platform democratizes access to financial support, enabling students to pursue their educational goals without the burden of financial uncertainty, while also building trust with contributors by ensuring that their funds are utilized as intended.
